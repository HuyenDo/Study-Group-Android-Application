# Study-Group-Android-Application
An application developed on Android Studio. The application allows user to login and start to create a multiple study group or questions and answers insides each study group. These answers or questions are arranged based on time created or the number of votes by users. We used Parse as our solution for the back end of the app so that multiple devices can run and see the updated questions or answers at run time. 

Technologies used: Java, Android Studio, and Parse.
